# Code-challenge-test

Nine COding challenge

Welcome to the 9Digital Coding Challenge! To complete this challenge, you will need to write and deploy a small JSON-based web service, and provide us the URL to your solution. Note: as this is also an exercise in set-up and deployment, please don't solve this by adding an endpoint to an existing app or service. Your service should be standalone and deployed at a root path e.g. http://myservice.somedomain.com/

You can take as long as you need to submit your solution. We expect fully developed and tested production quality code. Please think about testing, adding a README and other artifacts that would be expected of a professional, production-ready solution.
